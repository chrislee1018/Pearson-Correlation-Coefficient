## About

In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient, also referred to as Pearson's r is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data.  It is the covariance of two variables, divided by the product of their standard deviations. This creates a normalised measurement of covariance with a result between âˆ’1 and 1.  Usually, the Pearson coefficient is obtained via a Least-Squares fit and a value of 1 represents a perfect positive relation-ship, -1 a perfect negative relationship, and 0 indicates the absence of a relationship between variables.
